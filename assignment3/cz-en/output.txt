s of the Court of First Instance whose decisions may be challenged may, in particular, in so far as the case is sufficiently clear on the basis of the case-law of the Court, decide on the correct interpretation of Community law and its application on it made by the factual findings.
s for a preliminary ruling may nevertheless prove useful at a suitable stage of the proceedings as a particularly useful stage, in so far as it concerns a new question of interpretation which is of general importance for the uniform application of Community law in the Union or if the current case-law does not appear to be applicable to a fully new factual framework.

s in the case of the reference for a preliminary ruling The national court may submit a request to the Court for a preliminary ruling as soon as it finds that a decision on questions or questions of interpretation or validity is necessary to enable it to be issued by it; it is a national court which may best assess the stage of the proceedings must be made.
s are nevertheless desirable that the decision to refer the questions referred for a preliminary ruling is taken at the stage of the proceedings where the prosecuting judge is able to define the facts and legal framework of the problem in order to enable the Court to have any evidence necessary to verify that Community law is applicable in the main proceedings.

patients should be monitored carefully if any signs of bleeding including occult bleeding, particularly during the first weeks of treatment and/or after invasive cardiological performance or surgery.
ing clopidogrel with oral anticoagulants is not recommended since it may increase bleeding intensity (see section 4.5).
s, if the patient is to undergo the planned operation and antiagregation effect is not temporarily desirable, clopidogrel should be discontinued 7 days before the exercise.
s of patients should tell the doctor before planning any surgery or other pharmacotherapy before taking clopidogrel.
s Klopidogrel prolongs bleeding time and should therefore be given to patients with tendency to bleeding (specially gastrointestinal and intraocular) caution.
s should be informed that if clopidogrel (self or in combination with ASA), the haemorrhage of bleeding could last longer than usual and that they should inform their doctor about each unusual bleeding (place of occurrence or duration) of their doctor.

s in the first place, as the applicant correctly states, the provisions of EU law must be interpreted as far as possible in the light of international law, in particular where the objective of those provisions is to implement an international agreement concluded by the Community, such as that in the case of a basic regulation, which was adopted to meet international obligations arising from the anti-dumping Agreement (see recital 3 of the basic Regulation).

in this respect is sufficient that the common component is not negligible.
in the first place, the Court stated, first, that the overall impression which the mark applied for is dominated by the element ‘creationales kennya’, which the consumer concerned will focus on a wide extent and, secondly, in particular, in paragraph 44 of the judgment under appeal, that the element ‘ck’ in relation to the element ‘creationales kennya’ is only an intervener, which, in essence, concludes that the element ‘ck’ is negligible in the mark applied for.
s, the Court of First Instance, which excluded any similarity between the marks in the marks correctly carried out, in paragraphs 53 to 57 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance rightly concluded that, despite the good name of the earlier marks and the identity of the goods covered by the conflicting marks, there is no likelihood of confusion between those marks.
s 59 The third part of the first ground of appeal must therefore be declared unfounded.
60 In those circumstances, the first ground of appeal must be rejected.
s of appeal Arguments of the parties 61 By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains that it infringed Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94 when he failed to examine the reputation of the earlier marks within that provision.
s in the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance stated that, in paragraph 15 of the judgment under appeal, that the appellant alleges a single plea alleging infringement of Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/94 whereas the action was specifically based on infringement of Article 8(5) of that regulation.
s. 63 The Court of First Instance committed an error of law when it found that, since the conflicting marks were similar, it is not necessary to examine the good name of the earlier marks.
s, the fact that the earlier mark of the cK of Calvin Klein is generally known should be taken into account in the appellant for the purposes of determining whether it is necessary to grant a more extensive protection.
s, the good name of the earlier mark must be assessed in assessing similarity between the marks, not after similarity has been demonstrated.
in the present case, the appellant claims that if the prosperous mark of the cK was protected only if the third parties ‘cK’ would have used the same way of graphic formation would mean that the mark of the CK with a good name would be granted a level of protection which is practically lower than the level of protection which would have been not generally known.
s the fact that the mark cK and other different graphic graphics representation of those letters are famous, confers protection against the use of the ‘CK’ in the fashion sector, since the latter identify Calvin Klein in this sector so that their use by third parties is confusion through the association.
s of the European Union.
